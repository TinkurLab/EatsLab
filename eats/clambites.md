## Ingredients

* 4 oz by weight unsalted butter (needs to be very soft)
* 1.5 tsp mayonnaise 
* .75 tsp garlic powder  
* .5 tsp Kosher salt  
* 1 qty jar Old English Cheese Spread  
* 1 qty can (size??) minced clams drained  
* 6 qty English muffins fork split, halved, and quartered  

## Steps

1. Combine softened butter, mayonnaise, garlic salt and Old English cheese together in small mixing bowl. 
2. Mix in the drained minced clams. 
3. Put a blob of cheese mixture on each piece of English muffin and bake at 350 degrees on a cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes until crispy on bottom. Serve warm. 

## Notes

*You can make the mixture and freeze it, or refrigerate it ahead of time.
* I wonder what cheese would be good to replace the Old English Cheese Spread?

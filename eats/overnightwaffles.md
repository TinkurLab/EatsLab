# Overnight Waffles

## Ingredients

* 0.5 Tsp instance active yeast info 
* 16 oz by volume all purpose flour info 
* 1 Tbsp white sugar info 
* 0.5 Tsp sea salt info 
* 8 Tbsp butter, melted and cooled info 
* 0.5 Tsp vanilla extract info 
* 2 large eggs info 

## Steps

1. Before going to bed, combine the yeast, flour, sugar, milk. Mix. Then add butter and vanilla. The mixture will be loose. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. 
2. Preheat waffle iron to medium - high.
3. Spray waffle iron with Pam. 
4. Separate eggs. Mix two yolks into batter. Beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold them gently into the batter.
5. Spread 2c of batter (or as needed) on the waffle iron. Waffles take 3-5 minutes; done when the steam decreases and waffles are moderately browned.

## Notes

* Serve or keep warm in a 220 degree oven.
* Serve with powdered sugar and maple syrup.
* I used Breville waffle iron set to high. Recommend setting to medium high and seeing is its easier to not get dark brown waffles. However, ensure still maintain crispy on outside, soft on inside texture.
